            <h2>About Record On The Go</h2>
             <p>Record on the Go is an application aimed to allow you to have access to your medical record in a portable electronic way. We hope this will facilitate better long-term care and management of chronic illness. </p>

            <p>We understand that as a refugee, access to healthcare can be difficult and that doctor visits will be quick. You should not spend too much time repeating information or trying to track old prescriptions. Record on the Go will allow the doctors you meet along your journey to add/edit your medical records and view your previous prescriptions in one reliable e-health page. We believe that your medical data is YOURS, so you have full access to view this record and add comments. As well as the ability to add and remove doctors that you meet along the journey.</p>
            <p>Security is of utmost importance to us. We are not asking you for any personal/demographic information your data is completely anonymized.</p>
            <h2>Adding doctors</h2>
                <p>You have full control over who sees your medical record. To allow a doctor to access and edit your medical record, add the login name of their organization. By adding a doctor you give them permission that they will be able to view your previous records and create new records based on your appointment. The doctor will accept your request to view/edit your patient record. </p>
            <h2>Removing Doctors Access</h2>
            <p>When you would like to to limit the number of doctors/organizations who have access to your medical records you have the ability to remove doctors. To remove a doctor, click on their name and click remove. </p>
